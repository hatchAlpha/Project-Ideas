# Project Ideas for Alpha 2016-2017
Simply a repo of ideas and existing projects and how they can implemented into the Alpha program.

### A "net" Profit @ CWSF
> _This project is about predicting the price of the Intel stock, with a neural network. The network uses various inputs to predict the next day's prices. All data in this project was collected via web scrapers that ran everyday. All of the project was coded in Python. Now the network is able to predict stock with a mean error of 0.8% error._

### Generating Musical Accompaniment Using Machine Learning @ CWSF
> _In this project, a novel deep learning algorithm that is capable of producing a sophisticated musical accompaniment to a given melody is presented._

> Create a program that can suggest complimentary colours and/or gradients or create colour schemes based on user trends and the program's learning algorithm

### Chemlogic: A Logic Programming Chemistry System @ CWSF
> _Chemlogic is a logic program for computer chemistry that performs stoichiometric calculations, balances and completes equations, and converts between formulas and names. The program has applications in education, particularly as a study tool. Features are implemented using a chemical information database, linear equation solver, and grammatical rules. Guidance is provided for resolving errors in user input._

> A program that balances and processes names for equations. Error reporting and fix suggestions are possible features?

### Learn to mine Twitter on a topic @ Analytics Vidha
> _With help of twitter and a good data science tool, you can find out what the world is saying about a particular topic. I was mesmerized by this, when I did this for the first time. Be it reviews about movies, sentiments about elections or any hot topic off the press â€“ you can know what the people are saying by yourself_

> Create a data mining program to get information about trends in a topic, then parse and analytically present the findings.  
> Additionally, Twitter bots (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6atTSxoRiVnSuOn6JHnq2yV)

### Citymapper
> _Citymapper is reinventing the everyday urban transit app and making the large complicated city simple and usable. A to B trip planning with real-time departure information on all modes of transit_

> Plan the fastest TTC route to a location by using the virtualearth (Microsoft) API to get traffic reports (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh441726.aspx)
